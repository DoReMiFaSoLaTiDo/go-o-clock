### About
Events, Calendars, Appointment Schedules, Rosters, etc all revolve around a common article: Time

And for those that follow International News reports or events, won't it be great to have any datetime object in the news show up in your local time?

This project is a digest to explore tags and methods for local time conversion.

### Experiments
1. Process time and dates with Go actions;
2. Process time and dates in txt/html files and simulate browser render;
3. Stream txt/html file and emulate fetching data in parallel + unending scroll.
